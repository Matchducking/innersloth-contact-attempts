# Innersloth Report Evidence Archive

## Overview

This repository exists to **document, preserve, and centralize evidence of reports submitted to Innersloth through multiple official and public channels**, as well as to demonstrate how those efforts consistently resulted in **no effective action**.

The lack of response, remediation, or enforcement directly contributed to the escalation of abuse on the platform — including the emergence of automated bot attacks (“duck attacks”) that could have been prevented with timely intervention.

This repository is not speculation or opinion. It is an evidence archive.

## Purpose

The goals of this repository are:

* To provide **verifiable proof** that extensive and repeated attempts were made to alert Innersloth to serious issues.
* To establish a **clear timeline** showing inaction despite sufficient information.
* To explain **why community-driven countermeasures became necessary**.
* To prevent historical revisionism or denial of prior reports.

## Documented Support Attempts

The evidence in this repository covers, but is not limited to, the following efforts:

* **Official support ticket reports** submitted through Innersloth’s designated support systems.
* **Repeated outreach on Discord, X (Twitter), and other public platforms**, including direct mentions and replies.
* **Public disclosures**, including long-form videos and detailed explanations outlining the problems and their impact.
* **Large-scale predator friend-code tracking**, involving thousands of accounts, demonstrating organized and systemic abuse.
* **Direct communication channels**, including attempts to contact and notify **Innersloth executives**.

Despite the scale, clarity, and persistence of these reports, meaningful action did not occur.

## Why This Matters

The attacks and disruptions that followed were **not spontaneous**. They were the predictable outcome of prolonged neglect.

This repository exists to make one point unambiguous:

> These issues were reported early, reported often, and reported with evidence.

The responsibility for escalation lies with inaction, not with those who attempted to prevent harm.

## Scope and Limitations

* This repository focuses on **documentation**, not harassment.
* No content is included for the purpose of personal attacks.
* All materials are preserved to the extent necessary to demonstrate patterns, timelines, and outcomes.

## Status

This archive may continue to expand as additional evidence, records, or corroborating material becomes available.
