# Description

for those who don't want to read, let's do a simple sum up.

spaces in friendcode abuse was reported before Innersloth's winter holiday. Cmd exploits used by January duck were reported during and after the sloth winter holiday. I made like 4-6 contacts through SlothMail(where moderators can do nothing), support ticket(where official staff did nothing) and modding@innersloth.com(i lost the email for modding, since they never answered). 
There was a month for them to act but they lost the chance, while the exploits were being publicly revealed and widely used by duckomenu and ducky net client.
Then came the January duck attack, and as far as  can confirm, they patched spaces in friendcode in 3-4 hours and took 2-3 days to completely wipe out duck exploits.  They took such immediate action only after things got worse.
Above proved that Innersloth team, was really lazy to fix the issues even reported to them, and only to patch after duck attacks. Thus also proved that duck attack is a meaningful, useful, effective and probably the only working way at that moment to force Innersloth take actions and make the game environment better.
